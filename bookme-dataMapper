In case a segments array has only one element, what to do in that case
No duration in jazeera

how airsial second one is less than the first one

prices diff on airsial website compared to api





Things left to do tommorrow:
calculate time duration (carbob) --both
add segments --done
total fare -- add in aljazeera done in airsial
move date of a flight up the object --both
